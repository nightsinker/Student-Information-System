Student Management

Overview
This project implements a simple Student Information Management System using Python. It allows users to add, update, remove, display, and search for student records in the system. The program utilizes a dictionary to store student information and includes basic data validation for input fields such as admission numbers and scores.

Functionality
1. Add a New Student
The "Addstudent" function allows you to add a new student to the system. It prompts you to enter the student's admission number, name, module name, and score. The admission number is validated to ensure it is unique and follows the correct format. Names are capitalized to maintain consistency.

2. Update Student Information
The "updatestudents" function allows you to update existing student information. You can choose to update the student's name, module name, or score. The function displays the current information for the selected student and allows you to enter the new values.

3. Remove a Student
The "removestudent" function lets you remove a student from the system. It displays the student's information and asks for confirmation before deleting the record.

4. Display All Students
The "Display" function allows you to view the details of all students currently in the system. It shows each student's admission number, name, module name, and score.

5. Search for a Student
The "searchstudent" function enables you to search for a student using different criteria. You can search by admission number, module name, or score range. The function displays matching student information based on the selected search criteria.
